Oxford Alpha Fund Quantitative Strategies - cross-sectional momentum team

## Standard practice
Please upload Jupyter notebooks into the main folder.
- For any functions, either include these in the notebooks, or in a subfolder.

Before each week's meeting, please create an **issue**, clearly stating your name & the date. This should cover
- Work that has been achieved
- Work that is currently being done
- Problems you have encountered and possible solutions
- Next steps to research

## Data
**CorrectMembers** contains raw data for the most reliable (non-webscraped) set of tickers that we have. 
- These are merged into a dataframe **df_Merge.pkl**, which can be used as a basis for research. See below for resources that explain the column names.
- **CRSPMembers_TomLiu.ipynb** will also take you through the data manipulation process.
