**CorrectMembers** contains raw data for the most reliable (non-webscraped) set of tickers that we have. These are merged into a dataframe **df_Merge.pkl**, which can be used as a basis for research. See above for resources that explain the column names. **CRSPMembers_TomLiu.ipynb** will also take you through the data manipulation process.
